I recently stumbled across a cheap Dell Venue 11 Pro (7140) tablet that turned out to be an Intel Atom‑based machine running Windows 10 Pro.  The device is a surprisingly good fit for a portable penetration‑testing lab, and I managed to recover a Windows 10 Pro CD key from the OEM media.  While the key is largely obsolete in the age of Windows 11, it’s still handy for a quick homelab setup.

And apologies for the click-bait in the title. This setup is more for a pentesting training than anything. (-;

## Dell Venue 11 Pro (7140) – Quick Specs

| Feature | Details |
|---------|-------|
| **Screen** | 10.8" IPS, 1920×1080 Full‑HD |
| **Touch** | 10‑point multi‑touch |
| **CPU** | Intel Core M 5Y10c (800 MHz) |
| **GPU** | Intel HD Graphics 5300 |
| **RAM** | 4 GB DDR4 |
| **Storage** | 64 GB SSD [extendable with microSD] &nbsp; |
| **Battery** | 38 Wh [~80% of battery life] |

<br>

The tablet’s modest specs are more than enough for running a lightweight Linux distro like Parrot OS, and the 10‑point touchscreen makes it a handy mobile platform for on‑the‑go testing.
    I actually tried Kali on it but I was curious whether it's true that Parrot OS is slightly more lightweight. Well for one thing, the Plasma isn't really helping here. I think the feeling here is more of an autosuggestion. But it does look good!

## Installing Parrot OS on the Atom

Below is a loose list of problems I encountered. The process is largely the same as on any other Intel‑based laptop, but the wireless driver and network setup required a few extra tweaks. The Calamares installer is pretty good.

<br>

### Network problems
   * Connect an Ethernet cable – the tablet’s Wi‑Fi is a bit flaky.
   * Set the system clock correctly so HTTPS certificates validate.
   * The `realtek‑rtl88xxau‑dkms` package is required for the tablet’s RTL88xxU Wi‑Fi chipset.

   ```bash
   sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms -y
   ```

<br>

### Boot Menu
   * When powering up press Volume Up [or F12 on the keyboard]

<br>

### Install Parrot OS
   * Calamares takes it from there. Partitioning is pretty easy since we only have a single, small disk available.

<br>

### Post‑install tweaks
   * Adjust system time and locale - for some reason this unit gave me basic problems in this department [bios battery seems fine]
   * Configure `tmux` to my liking.
   * This is my preference but I made it join my homelab network one the day 1.

tailscale up --login-server=<my-homelab-headscale-url>

### ...and hack away! Some quick wins here

1. **Got a cheap Atom tablet** - ~~profit~~
2. **Recovered a Windows key** – that never happened to me before on a 2nd hand item
3. **Installed Parrot OS** – happy to continue testing this interesating alternative to Kali
4. **Added an external antenna** – plugged an Alfa antenna into the USB port, for potential wi-fi experiments
5. **Got a quirky gadget with cool wallpaper** – going to carry it to some local meetups
