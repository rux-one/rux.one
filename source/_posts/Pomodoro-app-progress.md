Few more hours of dibbling with the firmware and I am now confident I can make the Pomodoro app work. I learned about controllers & timers used in the current InfiniTime firwmare. I also noticed how the FreeRTOS queue is being used to communicate between apps.

The progress is looking good and can be viewed in the following video:

Next step is to see if it works on the actual device.
