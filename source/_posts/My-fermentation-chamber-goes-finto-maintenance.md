title: My fermentation chamber goes into maintenance mode

I started this project last year alongside my new healthy hobby - homebrewing. 

It's a quick and dirty, not very efficient "wine" chiller using some old Peltier cells.

But... it does the job! I am finishing my 5th batch of beer (Simcoe Sessiona IPA) and after it's done it will get the long due maintenance. 

Cable management is a nightmare. It's heavy and it's not properly sealed. A proper hack, but again - it helps maintaining ~18Â° (Celsius) which is required for this type of beer (Top fermentation).

Stay tuned.
